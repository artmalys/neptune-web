## Installation

Neptune Web is published to npm as two packages: [@transferwise/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@transferwise/components) and [@transferwise/neptune-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@transferwise/neptune-css).

**If you want to use the components, you need Neptune CSS and Icons.**

```bash
# yarn
yarn add @transferwise/components @transferwise/neptune-css @transferwise/icons
yarn add react react-dom react-intl prop-types currency-flags # peer dependencies

# npm
npm install @transferwise/components @transferwise/neptune-css @transferwise/icons
npm install react react-dom react-intl prop-types currency-flags # peer dependencies
```

**Note:** Peer dependencies are only necessary if you're using components. `currency-flags` is only required if you're using the <DocLink href="/components/inputs/MoneyInput">Money Input</DocLink> or if you're using flags on the <DocLink href="/components/inputs/Select">Select</DocLink>.

## Usage

```js
// These CSS imports only need to be imported once in your application
import '@transferwise/neptune-css/dist/css/neptune.css';
import '@transferwise/icons/lib/styles/main.min.css';

// This is only necessary if you are using the UMD build
import '@transferwise/components/build/main.css';

import { Provider, Button } from '@transferwise/components';
import translations from '@transferwise/components/build/i18n';

export default function App() {
  const currentLocale = ...

  return (
    // Components must be wrapped by the Provider component, which initialises and provides
    // context data for them. This should usually be done once at the top app level component
    <Provider i18n={{ locale: currentLocale, messages: translations[currentLocale] }}>
      ...
      <Button size={Button.Size.SMALL} block>...</Button>
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

For information on what classes are available, see the <DocLink href="/styles/core/Typography">styles documentation</DocLink>. Refer to <DocLink href="/components/inputs/Button">components</DocLink> for usage documentation, live previews and code snippets for each component.

By default, apps come polyfilled. If you would like to use an unpolyfilled version because your app provides its own polyfills, see [Advanced Components Usage](#advanced-components-usage) below.

## Translations and the Provider

You need to pass a translations object to the `Provider` component. This can be done in a few different ways, depending on the setup of your library / application.

Translation files can be accessed directly, which gives you the opportunity to load them dynamically:

```js
import de from '@transferwise/components/build/i18n/de.json';

const locale = 'zh-HK';
import(`@transferwise/components/build/i18n/${locale}.json`);
```

Or you can load them all at once:

```js
import translations from '@transferwise/components/build/i18n';
```

To avoid locale code mapping hassle you can use our internal mapping API:

```js
import { mapLocale, LOCALES, DEFAULT_LOCALE } from "@transferwise/components/build/es/polyfill/common/locale";
```

**Note:** `Provider` must be used in repositories which bundle components (i.e. lists `@transferwise/components` as a `dependency`). For repositories which don't bundle components (typically those that list it as a `peerDependency`) it is unnecessary (often it's similar component libraries).

You may need to add it to your development environment (you can do this in Storybook via decorators), demo pages or [tests](https://testing-library.com/docs/example-react-intl/#creating-a-custom-render-function).

## Advanced CSS Usage

We expose three bundles for use. Our `neptune.css` bundle has everything. This is what you should use if using components. If you aren't using components, you have the option of just using `neptune-core.css`, or that and `neptune-addons.css`. <DocLink href="/styles/core/Typography">Core</DocLink> includes normalising and base styles such as typography. <DocLink href="/styles/addons/BackgroundUtilities">Addons</DocLink> provide a number of utility classes for display, spacing and more.

**Note:** there are other files in the `dist/css` folder other than those mentioned here. Please do not rely
on them, as we may remove them in future releases.

```js
// Everything
import '@transferwise/neptune-css/dist/css/neptune.css';

// Core
import '@transferwise/neptune-css/dist/css/neptune-core.css';

// Addons
import '@transferwise/neptune-css/dist/css/neptune-addons.css';
```

## Advanced Components Usage

The components are exposed in two formats: UMD and ES. We also provide polyfilled and non-polyfilled versions.

### Which bundle should I use?

UMD is a combination of CommonJS and AMD. It works in both browser and server environments (Node). ES uses the standardized ES module format.

If you are using a bundler that supports ES module imports, you can use the ES build. If not, you will need the UMD build.

Because we declare standard `main` and `module` properties in our `package.json` file, if you are happy to use the polyfilled version it's likely that you will get the right import for your environment.

```
"main": "./build/umd/polyfill/main.js",
"module": "./build/es/polyfill/index.js",
```

We expose polyfilled versions by default, to ensure we meet our <DocLink href="/about/BrowserSupport">Browser Support</DocLink> policy. If your application already includes polyfills, you can optimise your bundle by including non-polyfilled versions of the components.

Below is a comparison of the different bundle options, along with where you can access them.

<table className="docs-table table table-condensed">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Bundle</th>
      <th>Default</th>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>Treeshaking</th>
      <th>Extra setup required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">UMD + polyfill</th>
      <td>
        <CheckIcon />
      </td>
      <td>
        <PrintBundleSize bundleSize={bundleSizes.umd['polyfill'][0]} /> (gzip:~
        <PrintBundleSize bundleSize={bundleSizes.umd['polyfill'][1]} />)
      </td>
      <td>
        <CrossIcon />
      </td>
      <td>None.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">UMD</th>
      <td>
        <CrossIcon />
      </td>
      <td>
        <PrintBundleSize bundleSize={bundleSizes.umd['no-polyfill'][0]} /> (gzip:~
        <PrintBundleSize bundleSize={bundleSizes.umd['no-polyfill'][1]} />)
      </td>
      <td>
        <CrossIcon />
      </td>
      <td>You must override the default import and include your own polyfill.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">ES + polyfill</th>
      <td>
        <CheckIcon />
      </td>
      <td>
        <PrintBundleSize bundleSize={bundleSizes.es.polyfill} />
      </td>
      <td>
        <CheckIcon />
      </td>
      <td>None.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">ES</th>
      <td>
        <CrossIcon />
      </td>
      <td>
        <PrintBundleSize bundleSize={bundleSizes.es['no-polyfill']} />
      </td>
      <td>
        <CheckIcon />
      </td>
      <td>You must override the default import and include your own polyfill.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you need to override the import to use a different bundle, here is where you can find the different combinations.

<table className="docs-table table table-condensed">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Bundle</th>
      <th>Location</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">UMD + polyfill</th>
      <td>
        <pre>@transferwise/components/build/umd/polyfill</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">UMD</th>
      <td>
        <pre>@transferwise/components/build/umd/no-polyfill</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">ES + polyfill</th>
      <td>
        <pre>@transferwise/components/build/es/polyfill</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">ES</th>
      <td>
        <pre>@transferwise/components/build/es/no-polyfill</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You will need to find out how to specify module overrides in your particular build environment. Here's an example of how to do it in Webpack:

```json
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@transferwise/components': require.resolve(
        '@transferwise/components/build/es/no-polyfill',
      ),
    },
  },
```

#### Tree-shaking

By default when importing this - `import { Button, Upload } from "@transferwise/components";` - you will get **polyfilled UMD** if your bundler doesn't support tree-shaking, **polyfilled ES** if it does.

export const meta = {
  name: 'Setup',
};
